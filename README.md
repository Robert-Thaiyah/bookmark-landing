## My process

- First I sought some samples from Dribbble but decided on using a simple approach on my profile, having only the skills, portfolio and contact pages.
- Then I built a shell uisng HTML and Tailwind.
- Added some small functionality using Javascript.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind and HTML.
